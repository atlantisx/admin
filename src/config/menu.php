     * The menu structure of the site. For models, you should either supply the name of a model config file or an array of names of model config
     * files. The same applies to settings config files, except you must prepend 'settings.' to the settings config file name. You can also add
     * custom pages by prepending a view path with 'page.'. By providing an array of names, you can group certain models or settings pages
     * together. Each name needs to either have a config file in your model config path, settings config path with the same name, or a path to a
     * fully-qualified Laravel view. So 'users' would require a 'users.php' file in your model config path, 'settings.site' would require a
     * 'site.php' file in your settings config path, and 'page.foo.test' would require a 'test.php' or 'test.blade.php' file in a 'foo' directory
     * inside your view directory.
